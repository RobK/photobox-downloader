Photobox Downloader
===================

Photobox Downloader is a NodeJS module and CLI tool to make interacting with and downloading of albums/photos easy.
[Photobox](http://www.photobox.ie) is a popular photo printing website, while possible to download each photo
one-by-one, there is no way to download an entire album at once. This project addresses that need.

While the app was developed against www.photobox.ie it should work against any of the other sister sites
(www.photobox.co.uk, www.photobox.fr, www.photobox.de, etc...)

Installation & Usage
----

```shell
npm install -g photobox-downloader

mkdir albums

pbdl
```

Once you run the `pbdl` application it will ask you for 4 items of information:

1. The domain that your photos are on (www.photobox.ie, www.photobox.co.uk, etc...)
1. The Authentication cookie value (see below for more detailed instructions)
1. The directory where to store the files (this directory **must exist already!**)
1. If you want to skip existing files (useful for resuming interrupted downloads)


**How to get authentication cookie value?**

When you log into your account on Photobox, Photobox sets an authentication cookie, if you know how to view cookies,
look for the `pbx_www_photobox_xx` (xx depends on where you are logging into) cookie, otherwise you can just log into
your Photobox account, open the Developer Toolbar (press F12), goto the "Application" tab (Chrome), expand the
"Cookies" drop down. Click on the base domain (e.g. https://www.photobox.ie), copy the value of the cookie
called "pbx_www_photobox_ie" (the last part, "_ie", will change depending on your domain).

Alternatively, you can use cURL to get it (username and password have to url encoded)

```bash
export EMAIL="yourmemail%40gmail.com" # url encoded email address
export PASS="password"

curl 'https://www.photobox.ie/'  -H 'User-Agent: ' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
 -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8' \
 -H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0' --cookie-jar - \
 --data 'global_action=login&email=$EMAIL&password=B$password&auto_sign_in=on&login=Sign+in' \
 --compressed | grep "pbx_www_photobox" | awk '{print $NF}'
```

Example API Usage
----

You can also use photobox-downloader module inside your own projects to programmatically download photos.

```javascript
var photoBox = require('photobox-downloader')(logger); // logger could be Winston logger or just 'console'
var config = {
  "baseDomain" : "www.photobox.ie",
  // change "authCookieValue" value to your own authentication cookie value, see "login" section below for more info
  "authCookieValue" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
};

// Login and download all photos from every album
photoBox.login(config, function (err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('ERROR! Something went wrong logging in, check your authCookieValue!');
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log('Logged into Photobox!');
    photoBox.downloadAll(
      {
        showProgress : true,
        outputDir    : __dirname + '/out'
      },
      function (err) {
        if (err) {
          console.log(err);
        } else {
          console.log('Done! All photos downloaded (that was easy!)');
        }
      }
    );
  }
});

```
